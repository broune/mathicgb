mathicgb
=========

Mathicgb is a program for computing Groebner basis and signature
Grobner bases. Mathicgb is based on the fast data structures from
[mathic](https://github.com/broune/mathic).

The paper "Practical Grobner Basis Computation" describes the
algorithms in Mathicgb from a high level. It was presented at ISSAC
2012 and is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6940
