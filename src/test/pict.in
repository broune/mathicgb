# The purpose of this file is to generate a set of test configurations
# where every pair of parameter values is present at least once. See
# the Wikipedia page on all pairs testing:
#
#  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pairs_testing
#
# This file is an input file for the Microsoft testing tool PICT.
# The tool is available at
#
#   http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/5/5/f55484df-8494-48fa-8dbd-8c6f76cc014b/pict33.msi 
#
# You will need to run this program on Windows. It is a closed source
# utility. There are open sources alternatives but they are not as good.
#
# To update the test in gb-test.cpp, update this file, run pict and
# place the output into the string allPairsTest in gb-test.cpp.
