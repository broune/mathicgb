/// A concurrent hash map from monomials to T. This map can resize itself
/// if there are too few buckets compared to entries.
///
/// Queries are supported through a MonomialMap::Reader object. On resize all
/// previous readers are subject to permanent spurious misses -
/// querying clients need to grab a fresh reader to confirm misses. Grabbing
/// a reader incurs synchronization so do not do it for every query.
///
/// External synchronization with writers is required if spurious misses are
/// not acceptable. There are no spurious hits. If misses are very rare then
/// reads can be done with minimal overhead by following this pattern:
///
///  1) grab a reader X
///  2) perform queries on X until done or there is a miss
///  3) replace X with a fresh reader Y
///  4) go to 2 if the miss is now a hit
///  5) grab a lock shared with all writers
///  6) perform the query again - a miss is now guaranteed to be accurate
///  7) release the lock after the processing of the miss is done and go to 2
///
/// There is no way to avoid locking if spurious misses are not acceptable
/// as otherwise a writer could make an insertion of the requested key at any
/// time while processing the miss - which then makes the miss spurious
/// after-the-fact.
