# set up information about directories

AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([build/autotools]) # directory for auxiliary build tools (install-sh etc)

# check that source directory is correct

dnl  contain this file then it knows that the directory is wrong.

# Enable optional maintainer mode (off by default)
dnl AM_MAINTAINER_MODE turns off automatic reconstruction of the build
dnl files if the source build files have changed. A developer will want
dnl those automatic reconstructions to happen so that changes to the
dnl build system are actually carried out. However, a user might not
dnl have the tools required to reconfigure and the need for
dnl reconstruction might be spurious if the last-modified date is set
dnl incorrectly on the build files.
dnl
dnl Passing the option [enable] to AM_MAINTAINER_MODE makes the
dnl non-reconstruction feature available, but only when turned on by
dnl passing the option â€“disable-maintainer-mode. This option is
dnl apparently useful to some package distributors.

# Set up Automake
dnl foreign: do not create the GNU-specific file COPYING and do not complain
dnl   that GNU-specific files like NEWS, README, AUTHORS and ChangeLog are
dnl   missing.
dnl -Wall: set Automake to emit all warnings it can. Is NOT RELATED to setting
dnl   warnings for other tools. For example, it wil not make the compiler
dnl   get a -Wall option.
dnl subdir-objects: Put object files in a directory structure based on
dnl   the directory structure of the source files. This way, two source
dnl   files with the same name in different directories do not conflict.
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign subdir-objects -Wall])

# if --enable-silent-rules is passed to ./configure or if V=0 is passed
# to make, then the compilation output will be much less verbose making
# it possible to spot warnings and errors as they go by.

dnl Set up AC_OUTPUT to create each file by copying an input file
