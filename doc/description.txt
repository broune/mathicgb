***** Introduction

Since I'm going into industry I won't be able to continue to do much
development on MathicGB. I have hope that the torch will be picked up
and in this document I am writing about my thoughts and knowledge
about MathicGB. I also make suggestions about projects that would
improve MathicGB and I indicate for each how much effort I think it
will be and how difficult I think it will be - some of these estimates
may be way off. This is all current as of September 24, 2013.

***** High-level view of MathicGB

The core engine of MathicGB is ClassicGBAlg, which implements the
classic Buchberger algorithm with some improvements, and SignatureGB
which implements the Signature Basis Algorithm. These classes do not
contain that much code, instead they use a lot of other classes to do
their bidding. They have classes for keeping track of the basis, for
keeping track of the S-pairs, for doing the reductions and for
representing the coefficients, monomials and polynomials. Some of
these are encapsulated behind virtual interfaces, so that different
implementations can be chosen at run-time. This is notably the case
for the reducers.

ClassicGBAlg also implements F4, which is achived by having a reducer
that does matrix-based reduction.

***** Installation for unix systems and Cygwin

gtest is downloaded automatically if it's not present (the download
requires wget). It's used for the unit tests. tbb is necessary for
parallel computation, but MathicGB will compile in a serial mode if
tbb is not found by ./configure. pkg-config and autotools are
required. mathic requires memtailor and mathicgb requires mathic and
memtailor.

If getting the source code from git, you need to do:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make install

Parallel builds with -jN are fully supported and safe.

Setting memtailor, mathic and mathicgb up in multiple different
configurations (release, debug, debug-without-asserts,
release-with-asserts etc.) is a lot of effort. Instead, take this file:

https://github.com/broune/mathicgb/blob/master/build/setup/make-Makefile.sh

Then type

  ./make-Makefile.sh > Makefile

then do "make". It'll download memtailor, mathic and mathicgb and link
them up with each other in multiple configurations. The configure
directories will be subdirectories of each project. The installed
files will go in a common installed/ directory.

Project(high-effort, medium-difficulty): Make nice packages for
memtailor, mathic and mathicgb for the various distributions and
Cygwin. Failing that, upload a source or perhaps even binary tarball
somewhere.

Project(medium-effort, medium-difficulty): Make a nice website for
mathic.

Project (medium-effort, low-difficulty): Set up a trac for MathicGB.

***** Installation for Visual Studio

There are Visual Studio 2013 project files for each project in
mathicgb/build/vs12. I have only tested these on the machine in my
office. tbb must already be installed in some place where Mathic can
find them.

Project (medium-to-high-effort, medium-difficulty): Get the Visual
Studio project files in git to work in Visual Studio Express and
document for other people how to do that. Improve the project files so
that they are as easy as possible to get running.


***** C++ concepts and miscellaneous MathicGB C++ stuff

These are things that will be helpful to know when developing for MathicGB.

-- Papers

To really get a good idea of the litterature you'll need to spend a
lot of time reading papers (possibly years). To get started on what's
relevant for MathicGB, here are a few suggestions:

-the SB/ISSAC paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6940

This paper describes a lot of algorithms and data structures used in
MathicGB. There is information here for both signature and classic
Groebner basis computation.

-- Details on undefined behavior in C and C++

It is useful to know what things invoke undefined behavior and what
the consequences are. Here's a good start on learning about that:

http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=234990
http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html

-- References are nicer than pointers

First of all: pointers are perfectly fine when you need them! However,
references are better when they can be used. If we ignore the
syntactic difference, a reference is a pointer that must never be null
or uninitialized and that will never change. Also, as a convention, a
reference is never an owner of the object it refers to. If you have a
pointer that satisfies those conditions, use a reference instead of a
pointer. That way you are clearly unambiguously communicating these
facts about the pointer/reference without having to write any
comments. That's a Very Good Thing. It turns out that most pointers do
satisfy these conditions, so most pointers should be references. The
notation for accessing fields on a reference happen to be nicer than
for pointers, too, though that's not really the main point. If you
have a good reason to use a pointer instead of a reference in some
specific case, then by all means go ahead.


-- RAII and why owning pointers are evil

A resource is something that needs to be released when you are done
with it. The most common kind of resource is a piece of memory, but
there are many others: files, internet connections, database
connections, threads and so on. When you are holding a resource, you
will, at the very least, get a resource leak if you forget to release
the resource. You might also release the resource twice by mistake or
keep using the resource after releasing it. Those things are likely to
crash your program. Manually freeing every resource exactly one time
at the right time and then never using it again is error prone. That's
why memory leaks are a common problem and it is why garbage collection
is so popular, even though garbage collection only takes care of the
memory resources and it introduces its own issues.

std::unique_ptr is the premier example of RAII.

http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization

RAII stands for Resource Acquisition Is Initialization. RAII solves
most of the resource management problem and it's a stand-out great
feature of C++. The idea is that every resource is owned by a
dead-simple handle object. The destructor of the handle object frees
the resource. Every resource is given over to a handle object
immediately. This way it is impossible to forget to release the
resource, because you do not need to do anything to make it happen -
it happens automatically when the handle goes out of scope (if on the
stack) or if the owner of the handle is destructed. The presence of a
handle then also makes it immediately clear what object owns the
resource - it is whatever object holds the handle. You will know what
owns what just by looking at the types involved.

Using std::unique_ptr has two phases: first allocate an object on the
heap, then construct a unique_ptr handle to own/manage the object. The
problem here is that something bad, like an exception, might happen
between these two steps, or you might forget the second step. Here's a
subtle example where this happens:

  void foo(std::unique_ptr<int>, std::unique_ptr<int)>);
  void bar() {
    foo(std::unique_ptr<int>(new int(1)), std::unique_ptr<int>(new int2));
  }

This is a memory leak. The order of evaluation of parameters to
functions is unspecified in C and C++, and it's even valid to
interleave the execution of parameter expressions, so this is a valid
order of execution:

  1. new int(1)
  2. new int(2)
  3. constructor of the first std::unique_ptr<int>
  4. constructor of the second std::unique_ptr<int>

If the allocation in step 2 causes an exception (std::bad_alloc, or
maybe something more excotic if it were a more complicated class than
int), then the int allocated in step 1 will be leaked.

The solution to all of these problems is to avoid writing new whenever
you can (which is almost always). Instead call a function that both
allocates the resource and also initializes and returns the handle. In
C++14 there is supposed to be a std::make_unique that will do
that. C++14 isn't here yet, so instead there is a make_unique defined
in stdinc.h - use that one.. This is how to fix bar():

  void bar() {
    foo(make_unique<int>(1), make_unique<int>(2));
  }

The execution of function calls cannot be interleaved in the that
dangerous way, so there is no problem when doing it this way. Not only
is this now safe from memory leaks, it is simpler, requires less
typing and looks nicer too. :)

Here is another example:

  http://tipsandtricks.runicsoft.com/Cpp/SmartPointerMemLeak.html

In the absence of RAII, what you are left with is owning pointers and
other owning handles that do not know how to free their resource. In a
program full of such things, it is generally difficult to figure out
what object owns what resource. It can be cumbersome and error prone
to do the right thing even when ownership is clear. Here is a
reasonable way of implementing foo() and bar() in a world without
RAII, complete with the necessary comment to communicate the pass of
ownership:

  // Hey everyone, remember that foo takes over ownership of both pointers!
  void foo(int*, int*);

  void bar() {
    int* a = new int(1);
    int* b;
    try {
      b = new int(2);
    } catch (...) {
      delete a;
      throw;
    }
    foo(a, b);
  }

Not so nice. Also, what if bar ended like this:

    foo(a, b);
    delete a;
    delete b;
  }

That would be a bug, but not a very obvious one - you need to go read
the comment from foo() about ownership being passed on to know what's
wrong - that comment might be in a different file. It could be worse:
ownership could be passed for the first parameter, but not the
second. Then you'd really need to make sure you got things just
right. RAII saves us from worrying about most of this kind of
stuff. RAII is good. Learn to love RAII.

Sometimes RAII is not a good option, for example when the amount of
context required to free a resource makes the handle object too large
which then becomes a memory consumption or cache size issue. In those
cases you might need to not use RAII, but then at least try to
encapsulate this ugliness behind a nice interface that completely
hides the ugly truth from the rest of the program.

Here's an anti-pattern for RAII, which cannot always be avoided, but
usually it can:

  void foo(const unique_ptr<int>& ptr);

why does foo() care about the int being handled from a unique_ptr? It
cannot change the unique_ptr, so all it can do with it is the same
thing you can do with a pointer. Furthermore, this can be a
performance issue, because you get a double indirection. The reference
is an indirection and the unique_ptr is an indirection, so in
performance terms this is like passing an int**.

If ptr cannot be null, this is much better:

  void foo(const int&);

Since copying an int is no big deal, this is even better:

  void foo(int);

If ptr can be null, then you do need a pointer, but there's no reason
to specify that it must be a unique_ptr:

  void foo(int* ptr);

This is fine and not a contradiction to the idea of using RAII. The
reason for that is that ptr does not own what it points to and no
ownership is being passed. The evil pointers are the pointers that own
what they point to.

-- r-value references and move semantics

Another write-up of these topics: http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/rvalue_references.pdf

Among many other things, move semantics solves the inefficiency in this
example:

  std::string foo(const std::string& str) {return str + '!';}
  void bar() {
    auto str = foo("hello world");
  }

This is what happens here:

  1. A temporary std::string is constructed in bar to hold "hello world"
  2. foo gets a reference to that string object.
  3. foo constructs a new string object that holds "hello world!"
  4. bar receives that new string object.
  5. bar deconstructs the old string object holding "hello world"

Now you might say that it looks like there would be a copy, because we
need to copy the object returned from foo into str in bar(). In fact
the compiler is free to elide this copy:

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_value_optimization

Still, this is not efficient. We are allocating memory to hold "hello
world". Like std::vector, std::string is free to over-allocate memory,
so that original std::string might well have enough capacity to hold
the final string "hello world!". We should reuse the memory from the
first object to hold the final string. Then there might be only the
single allocation instead of two.

We declared the reference to be const, so we should not alter the
passed in std::string. We could proceed with overloading like this:

  std::string& foo(std::string& str) {return str += '!';}
  std::string foo(const std::string& str) {return str + '!';}

It's true that we now re-use the passed-in string, but this is an
abomination! The caller might be holding a non-const std::string but
still not want it to change. In some other part of the program, it
might be very important that that std::string does not
change. Besides, this code:

  auto str = foo("hello world");

will actually call foo(const std::string&). That's a very good thing,
too. The reason for that is that you should not being doing things
like this:

  std::string& str = std::string("hello world!");

The right hand side here constructs a temporary std::string object
which str then refers to. That temporary object goes away (is
destructed) as soon as that line is done executing. If the next line
is

  std::cout << str;

then str is now referring to an invalid object and this might well
crash the program. To save us from this fate, C++ will flag an error
on the code above. The compiler will say something like this:

  cannot bind an r-value reference to an l-value reference

All the references that we know and love and that are spelled with a &
(like int&) are l-value references. An r-value reference is something
like the above example: it is a reference to something unnamed. In
classic C++, the main (only?) way to get an r-value reference is to
construct a temporary object. Temporary objects are going to die very
soon. So it's always a bad idea to have an l-value reference (that is,
a usual reference) bind to an r-value, because that's going to be an
imminent disaster like in this example. So C++ flags that kind of
thing as an error. That's why this code:

  auto str = foo("hello world");

does not select the foo(std::string&) overload - the temporary
std::string object that gets constructed is an r-value, so we cannot
bind it to an l-value reference and std::string& is an l-value
reference.

The overload that does get selected is foo(const std::string&), which
shows that we CAN bind r-values to CONST l-value references. I am
guessing that the idea here is that changing temporary objects does
not make much sense, since they are going to away very soon anyway.

Aha, you might object, does that not make this code an imminent
disaster, just like before?

  const std::string& str = std::string("hello world!");
  std::cout << str;

Nope. There is no error here. Not a compile-time error and not a
run-time error. This will work. The reason for that is that if you
bind a temporary object to a CONST l-value reference, then the
lifetime of the temporary object is extended to the life-time of the
reference. So by binding to a const l-value reference, we are
preventing the temporary std::string from being destructed at the end
of the line.

What's the point of a special rule for const l-value references? By
treating const l-values specially, we are allowing code like this to
work:

  std::string foo(const std::string& str) {return str + '!';}
  void bar() {
    auto str = foo("hello world");
  }

If we could not bind the temporary std::string from the caller (an
r-value) to the const std::string& (an l-value reference) that foo
accepts, then this sort of thing would be a compile-time error. You'd
be forced to do this:

  void bar() {
    const std::string bah("hello world");
    auto str = foo(bah);
  }

Wouldn't that just be sad? So const l-value references are special.

(You might ask: why not have non-const l-value references also work in
this special way? I don't know a good reason, but the fact is that
they do not.)

So what can we do? C++11 to the rescue. In C++11 we have a way to
spell r-value reference. An int r-value reference type is spelled
int&&. So we can do this:

  std::string&& foo(std::string&& str) {return str += '!';}
  std::string foo(const std::string& str) {return str + '!';}

This is a bit better than before. The first overload will only be used
when the parameter is a non-const r-value std::string, like in this
case:

  auto str = foo("hello world");

However, the r-value overload will not be used here:

  std::string importantStringThatShouldNotBeChanged = "don't change me";
  auto str = foo(importantStringThatShouldNotBeChanged);

Here the important string object is not a temporary object, so it's
not an r-value (more precisely, it has a name, so it's not an
r-value). There we cannot bind the important string object to an
r-value.

So we only use the r-value overload when the object being passed in is
a temporary object. That means that no one else in the program can
reasonably have a reference to it (how would they?). So it's always
going to be OK to steal that object and use it for our own
purposes. So this is a lot better.

It's still not good, though. Consider this example:

  const std::string& str = foo("hello world");
  std::cout << str;

We are expecting foo() to return a temporary object and to be safe we
are using a const l-value reference to capture the temporary
object. That way we know that the life-time of the temporary will be
extended so that str will still refer to a valid object on the next
line when we print it out. Except it doesn't work like that.

The problem here is that foo doesn't return a temporary object, not
from the compiler's perspective. It returns a reference. Extending the
life-time of that reference does nothing. What we need is to extend
the life-time of the temporary object that was passed to foo. Yet the
compiler does not see that temporary object being directly bound to a
const l-value reference. It just sees that object being passed to
foo(). So the life-time does not get extended. It does not matter that
foo() happens to return a reference to the same object.

What can we do? We can fix it by returning a std::string object
instead of returning a referenceL

  std::string foo(std::string&& str) {return str += '!';}

Of course now there will be a copy, so we are back to square one -
almost. We still know that no other part of the program is supposed to
have a reference to str. We are the only ones holding str, so we are
also the only ones holding the memory used by str. If we could somehow
break the encapsulation of std::string and take the pointer to that
memory from inside str and directly get the returned object to just
use that pointer, then there would not need to be a copy.

We cannot break the encapsulation of std::string (or at least
shouldn't), but it happens to be that C++11 has a way of achieving
exactly this goal. It's called std::move. We can use it like this:

  std::string foo(std::string&& str) {
    str += '!';
    return std::move(str);
  }

std::move<T> is a template. What it does is to take an l-value
reference T& and return an r-value reference T&& to the same
object. Think of it as a cast - it changes the type of something, but
it doesn't do anything other than that. So by using std::move, we can
force the compiler to think that something is an r-value, even when it
isn't (and str isn't, see below).

The magic ingredient here is that std::string has a constructor that
accepts a std::string&&. That constructor steals the memory from the
passed-in std::string (and removes it from that std::string). So the
memory is transferred with no copying and no allocation. That is safe
because that r-value reference is supposed to refer to a temporary
object that is about to die, so no one else has a reference to it - so
no one should ever know that its memory has been stolen. It's like
stealing a painting out of a burning building - no one is going to
know the difference. We used std::move to trick the compiler into
thinking that our str was an r-value reference, but we only did that
in a situation where we knew that no one else would use that
std::string anymore - because we also accepted that std::string as an
r-value reference outselves. So as long as we only use std::move at
the right places, all is well.

You might be saying: wait a moment, isn't str ALREADY an r-value
reference? It's type is std::string&& and you said that && means
r-value reference. The type of str is indeed std::string&&. However,
consider this:

  std::string q;
  foo(q);

Here foo(const std::string&) gets called, but the type of q is NOT
const std::string&. It is std::string. The point here is that when you
want to figure out what kind of reference you get, do not look at the
type of the thing, look at the context. If something doesn't have a
name, then it's an r-value reference in that context. If it has a
name, then it's an l-value reference in that context. Both q and str
have names, so when we use the names q and str in the program, we get
l-value references, not r-value references. It doesn't matter that q's
type is not an l-value reference and it does not matter that str's
type is not an l-value reference. It's not about the type. It's about
having a name or not having a name in a specific context.

This is where we got to:

  std::string foo(std::string&& str) {
    str += '!';
    return std::move(str);
  }
  std::string foo(const std::string& str) {return str + '!';}

The first overload will reuse memory that isn't beeing used anywhere
else anyway and the second overload will allocate new memory because
we might need to preserve the original passed-in std::string. So far
so good. We can actually simplify this a bit:

  std::string foo(std::string str) {
    str += '!';
    return std::move(str);
  }

Here we always construct an object from the parameter, but we use
std::move to return it, so there is no copy there (there is something
called the return value optimization that is relevant here, but let's
save that for later). Let's consider four ways of calling foo:

  1. std::string a("don't change me"); foo(a);
  2. foo(std::string("change me if you want"));
  3. foo("I'm a string");
  4. std::string b("you can change me too"); foo(std::move(b));

For 1, a has a name, so it's an l-value reference. std::string has a
constructor that takes an l-value reference std::string&, and that
constructor copies. So there is a copy, but only the one, just as
before. For 2, we construct a temporary unnamed object, which is then
an r-value reference, and std::string has a constructor that accepts a
std::string&& parameter. That contructor steals the memory without
copying, so there is no copy at all, just like before. For 3, that's
the same as 2, except the temporary std::string is implicit. For 4,
the b in std::move(b) is an l-value reference just as for 1, but we
use std::move to cast it to an r-value reference, so what happens is
the same as for 2 and 3: the memory gets stolen out of b. As long as
we remember never to use b again, that's fine.

Consider this example:

  std::string a("I'm a string");
  std::string b("You're a string");
  b = std::move(a);

std::string also has an operator=(std::string&&) which steals the
memory out of the parameter. So what happens in the third line here is
that b frees its own memory and steals the memory out of a - which is
fine as long as we remember never to use a again.

The precise contract is if that a standard library object is moved out
of, then that object is placed in a valid but unspecified state. It is
guaranteed that it is OK to destruct an object that has been moved
from, but otherwise there is no general guarantee, though some classes
might give stronger guarantees.

std::vector has move (r-value) a constructor and a move operator= just
like std::string does. So does lots of classes in the standard library
in C++11. Consider this:

  std::vector<std::string> v;
  v.push_back("1");
  v.push_back("2");
  v.push_back("3");
  // ...

v might incur several reallocations during all these
push_backs. Inside the reallocation, std::vector knows that all the
old objects that it has been storing are going to disappear in a
moment (modulo a caveat about a different feature called noexcept that
I don't want to get into here). So no other part of the program ought
to be looking at those objects at any time in the future. So it's safe
to move the strings using std::move and that way the new strings just
steal the memory from the old strings instead of allocating new memory
and copying.

Objects that can be moved are said to have move semantics.

std::unique_ptr has move semantics, though it uses them for a
different purpose than std::string and std::vector. std::unique_ptr
never copies anything, so the point is not to avoid copies. The point
is that only a single unique_ptr should ever own the memory being
pointed to. So we want this to be a compile-time error:

  std::unique_ptr<int> a = make_unique<int>(1);
  std::unique_ptr<int> b;
  b = a;

If we allowed the third line, then both a and b would now own the
memory, leading to a double free. We could set a's pointer to null in
preserve the invariant, but then it becomes very easy to null out your
std::unique_ptr by accident. It's quite confusing for "b = a" to
change a. We only expect it to change b. If you try the code above,
you will get an error on the third line. The reason for that is that
std::unique_ptr has an 

  operator=(std:unique_ptr&&)

but not an

  operator=(std::unique_ptr&)

a is an l-value reference, and we already know that we cannot bind
l-value reference to the r-value reference type std::unique_ptr&&. So
this is a compile error. To fix it, we can do this:

  b = std::move(a);

Now we have cast a to an r-value reference. What happens here is that
b gets a's memory and a is set to null. This is no longer
confusing. There is no mystery that a got changed since we explicitly
did std::move(a). Did you spot this line?

  std::unique_ptr<int> a = make_unique<int>(1);

Here we are initializing a from a std::unique_ptr, and we did not use
std::move to cast the other std::unique_ptr to an r-value. Why is that
OK? Because it's already an r-value - it doesn't have a name. So no
other part of the program should have a reference to that object and
therefore moving out of it is safe.

-- implicit moves

Consider this code:

  std::unique_ptr<int>& baz() {
    auto ptr = make_unique<int>(1);
    *ptr = 2;
    return ptr;
  }

This will compile but it's very bad - we are returning a reference to
an object that lives on the stack inside the function. That object
will no longer be valid when the function returns. So how about this:

  std::unique_ptr<int>&& baz() {
    auto ptr = make_unique<int>(1);
    *ptr = 2;
    return std::move(ptr);
  }

Is that OK? No it's not and for exactly the same reason - l-value
references that refer to invalid objects are bad and it's just the
same thing for r-value references that refer to invalid objects. You
need to do it like this:

  std::unique_ptr<int> baz() {
    auto ptr = make_unique<int>(1);
    *ptr = 2;
    return std::move(ptr);
  }

Here we move the memory of ptr into the returned object using
std::unique_ptr's move constructor (that is, the one accepting an
r-value reference), but we do not return the ptr object itself - that
object is left to die when the function returns (it's a harsh world
for a stack-allocated variable).

In fact, we can rewrite baz like this:

  std::unique_ptr<int> baz() {
    auto ptr = make_unique<int>(1);
    *ptr = 2;
    return ptr;
  }

This looks wrong at first sight because std::unique_ptr's constructor
requires an r-value reference. Clearly, ptr has a name, so it's an
l-value. What gives? The point is that we are returning a local object
- one allocated on the stack. When we get to the return statement, the
compiler knows that this object is just about to go out of scope and
be destructed. This is exactly the same situation as for a temporary
object - it is just about to be destructed. So in this very specific
circumstance, it is OK to let ptr be an r-value (just as if it had
been an unnamed temporary), and that's how it is in C++11. So the
std::move is superfluous in this case.

-- universal references and perfect forwarding

So far there has been a simple rule: & means l-value reference and &&
means r-value reference. It's not that simple, unfortunately. Suppose
we want to make out own 2-parameter make_unique function. Let's try
that:

  template<class T, class Arg1, class Arg2>
  std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique(const Arg1& arg1, const Arg2& arg2) {
    return std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(arg1, arg2));
  }

This isn't so good, though. What if T's constructor requires a
non-const l-value reference? What if T's constructor requires an
R-value reference? References can also be volatile. So we need overloads for

  Arg1&
  const Arg1&
  volatile Arg1&
  volatile const Arg1&
  Arg1&&
  const Arg1&&
  volatile Arg1&&
  volatile const Arg1&&

That's 8 overloads. We need the same thing for the second argument,
leading to 8*8=64 overloads. If we want to offer a 10 parameter
make_unique, then that would require 8 raised to the power of 10
overloads. Not good.

In fact we only need a single overload, namely this one:

  template<class T, class Arg1, class Arg2>
  std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique(Arg1&& arg1, Arg2&& arg2) {
    return std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(arg1, arg2));
  }

So how does this work? Suppose the arguments are const int&, like here:

  const int i = 1;
  make_unique<MyClass>(i, i);

Then Arg1 and Arg2 gets resolved to const int&. So it becomes like this:

  template<class T, class Arg1, class Arg2>
  std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique(const int& && arg1, const int& && arg2) {
    return std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(arg1, arg2));
  }

You can't directly write & && without an error, but if that appears in
a case like this, then there are rules for how to resolve it. The rules are:

 & & becomes &
 & && becomes &
 && & becomes &
 && && becomes &&

This is called reference collapsing. So it becomes:

  std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique(const int& arg1, const int& arg2) {
    return std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(arg1, arg2));
  }

That's exactly what we wanted! Let's try that again for a r-value
reference parameter:

  volatile int i;
  make_unique<SomeClass>(std::string("hi"), i)

Here we get Arg1 to be std::string&& and since && && becomes &&, we get

  std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique(std::string&& arg1, volatile int& arg2) {
    return std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(arg1, arg2));
  }

That's the right overload that we want, but the implementation of the
function isn't what we want. arg1 was passed to us as an r-value, so
we want to pass it to the constructor of T also as an
r-value. However, since we gave arg1 a name, it counts as an
l-value. What we want is this:

  std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique(std::string&& arg1, volatile int& arg2) {
    return std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(std::move(arg1), arg2));
  }

However, we can't just put a move in there, because then we'd also be
casting other parameters to r-values, even those that were not passed
to us as r-values. What we need is to do a conditional cast, a cast
that says: "cast this to an r-value, but only if Arg1 is an r-value
reference". That's exactly what std::forward<T>() does, so this is the
final and correct implementation:

  template<class T, class Arg1, class Arg2>
  std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique(Arg1&& arg1, Arg2&& arg2) {
    return std::unique_ptr<T>
      (new T(std::forward<Arg1>(arg1), std::forward<Arg2>(arg2)));
  }

This is called perfect forwarding, because we managed to pass the
exact type of the parameters on to the constructor of T, no matter
what kind of type it is - and we didn't need 64 overloads to do
it. The main consequence of this is that && doesn't necessarily mean
r-value when used with a template parameter.

There's even a further quirk on this: this process I just described
ONLY works when the parameter is "T&&" where T is a template
parameter. If you do for example "const T&&" and try to pass in an
l-value, then you'll get an error - reference collapsing will not
occur. Or if you do "volatile T&" and then try to pass in a const
volatile int, then you'll still get an error because the template
will only accept non-const volatile T's. So template parameters of the
form "T&&" are very special and it is only in this context that &&
doesn't necessarily mean r-value.

Well, almost (I'm sensing a theme here). auto is kind of like a
template parameter and it has the same special case. If you do:

  auto&& x = ...

Then now x will be of whatever kind the right hand side is following
the same reference-collapsing process as I just described:

  const std::string a;
  auto&& aa = a; // aa is a const std::string&
  auto&& bb = std::string(); // bb is a std::string&&

Here aa has the type of an l-value reference even though it is
declared with &&. Again, this only works for the special case of
"auto&&". It does not work for "const auto&&", for example, so this
is an error:

  const std::string c;
  const auto&& cc = c;

The problem is that cc is now hard-coded to be actually an r-value
reference and c is an l-value.

Because the cases for "T&&" and "auto&&" are so special, they've been
given a special name: universal reference. They are called that
because they can refer to any type you want.

A final point about r-value references: an r-value reference (of
whatever kind) extend the life of a temporary, just like a const
l-value does. So this is OK:

  std::string&& str = std::string("hello world!");
  std::cout << str;

-- Range-based for loops

They look like this:

  std::vector<int> v;
  for (int x : v) {
    // ...
  }

x will go through each element in v in turn using a hidden
iterator. This works for any container v where std::begin(v) and
std::end(v) returns iterators. The default implementation of these
just call v.begin() and v.end() (they are templates that you can
partially specialize to do something else if you want), so it'll also
work with any class that has .begin() and .end().

range-based for loops are awesome. This is the same thing as above in C++03:

  std::vector<int> v;
  std::vector<int>::const_iterator end = v.end();
  for (std::vector<int>::const_iterator it = v.begin(); it != end; ++it) {
    int x = *it;
  }

Using auto, this could be improved to

  auto end = v.end();
  for (auto it = v.begin(); it != end; ++it) {
    int x = *it;
    // ...
  }

and if we do not care about the possible inefficiency of not caching
v.end(), we can further simplify to:

  for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
    int x = *it;
    // ...
  }

This is a much noisier syntax than the much simpler range-based
for. There are two main idioms for using range-based for. If you want
to do a scan through a range where you modify the contents of the
range, do:

  for (auto& x : v)

if you only want to observe the elements of the range, do

  for (const auto& x : v)

This way, it's always immediately clear what's going on. The
alternatives that I would advise to avoid (unless there's some good
reason) are:

  for (auto x : v) // could be inefficient, doesn't spell out "const"

and

  for (auto&& x : v) // universal reference makes intended constness unclear



-- don't call a method getFoo(), findFoo(), calculateFoo(),
 pleaseComeBackToMeFoo() or anything like that, just call it foo()

It's more succint, reads better and is just as clear. Do use setFoo or
similar if you want to set a field.

-- pointerness and reference-ness is a part of a variable's type

The format for a variable declaration is "type
variableName". Pointerness and variableness is part of the type, so
it's

  int* a;
  int& a;

and not

  int *a;
  int &a;

and also not

  int * a;
  int & a;

This notation has the drawback for this case, which becomes confusing:

  int* a, b;

this is equivalent to

  int* a;
  int b;

which is absolutely horrible, of course. The answer is simple: never
declare two variables in one statement using a comma.

-- don't use using

You've likely noticed all the std:: prefixes by now. MathicGB does not
have "using namespace std;" anywhere. There's not even "using
std::vector;" or anything like that. using should not be used in
headers because code that includes that header will be forced to use
the using which might cause name clashes. using should therefore also
not be used in implementation files because then moving code between
headers and implementation files becomes annoying. I didn't like the
std:: prefixes initially, but you get used to it. Now it doesn't
bother me at all.



-- if it can be const, make it const

Bugs generally happen when something changes. const things don't
change. So there will be fewer bugs!

It can also aid optimization in a special case. The const in const
int& doesn't help the optimizer at all, since it would be possible to
cast away the constness or change the value using a non-const
reference. However const int does help the compiler (not a reference),
because objects originally declared const are not allowed to change,
not even using const_cast. Example:

  int a = 1; // can change
  const int& aa = a;
  const_cast<int&>(aa) = 2; // OK (well, at least according to the standard)

  const int b = 1; // must not change
  const int& bb = b;
  const_cast<int&>(bb) = 2; // undefined behavior!
  

-- Do #includes from least general to most general

This way you are more likely to spot missing include files in headers.


-- use auto whenever you can unless you've got a special reason not to

Bad: std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> pairs(std::begin(r), std::end(r))
Good: auto pairs = rangeToVector(r)

Get an editor that will show you the types of variables as a tooltip
on mouse-over if you want to know the types.

-- Learn to love the assert

MathicGB has MATHICGB_ASSERT. You'll see it sprinkled liberally all
over the code. If you can assert on it, then do assert on it. If the
debug build gets to slow from a particularly slow assert, then profile
the debug build (yes, that makes sense! :) and disable just the few
asserts that were the problem. Assert is your best friend in this
world when programming.

-- The format of an X.cpp file

Note that no file contains anyone's name in the copyright header. We
don't want to get into discussions about how much or little someone
needs to do to put their name there. It gets hairy when parts of a
file are moved elsewhere. Long lists of names in files also isn't
useful to the purpose of the project.

The purpose of the namespace macroes is to avoid having to indent
everything by a level, which editors will otherwise want to do.

-- whitespace

No tabs. Indentation is 2 spaces per level. If you are used to 8 space
indent, you may think that 2 space indent makes code unreadable. It
doesn't. It's just hard for you to read because you've trained your
eyes to focus on the spot 8 spaces ahead and now you have to correct
the position of your eyes constantly until your habit adjusts. I find
8 space indent unreadable for the same reason - I'm used to 2 space
indent now, so I have to adjust my eyes too all the time when I read 8
space indented code. It's got nothing to do with the inherent
readability of 2 versus 8 spaces, it's got to do with a habit of where
to focus one's eyes. 2 space indent preserves horizontal space and is
no less readable than 8 or 4 space indent, so that's why I'm using it.

An opening { goes on the same line, unless the current line is
indented and the next line is indented to the same level. In a
parenthesized expression that does not fit on a line, the outer () is
indented in the same way as {}. For example (imagine that these
examples don't fit on a line):

int Foo::bar(
  int x,
  int y
) const {
  // ...
}

int Foo::Foo(
  int x,
  int y,
):
  mX(x),
  mY(y)
{ // on own line since previous line is indented to same level
  // foo
}

-- names

Macroes are ALL_UPPER_CASE and prefixed with
MATHICGB_. CamelCaseIsTheThing otherwise. First letter of TypeNames is
capitalized. First letter of functions and variables is
lowerCase. Member variables are prefixed with an m, so

***** Description of all files in MathicGB

*** mathicgb/Atomic.hpp

Offers a MathicGB alternative to std::atomic with some of the same
interface. Use this class instead of std::atomic. It was necessary to
use this class because the std::atomic implementations that shipped
with GCC and MSVC were so slow that they were just completely
unusable. This is supposed to be better in newer versions. When not on
MSVC or GCC, Atomic is simply a thin wrapper on top of std::atomic.

Atomic also has another use in that you can define
MATHICGB_USE_FAKE_ATOMIC. Then Atomic does not actually implement
atomic operations. This way, we can measure the overhead for atomicity
and memory ordering by running on one thread, since the atomicity and
memory ordering is not necessary for one thread.

Project (medium-effort, easy-difficulty): Figure out if GCC and MSVC
really do ship a usable-speed std::atomic now and, if so, which
versions are good and which are bad. Then let Atomic be implemented in
terms of std::atomic on those good versions while retaining the fast
custom implementation for the bad versions. The main effort involved
here is in getting access to all the different versions of GCC and
MSVC. This project could also be done for Clang.


*** mathicgb/Basis.hpp

A container of Polynomials that does nothing fancy. There is really no
reason for this class to exist - it should be replaced by
std::vector<Poly>. The class uses std::unique_ptr<Poly>, but since
Poly now has move semantics there is no reason for using unique_ptr
here.

Project: Remove class Basis and replace it with std::vector<Poly>.


*** mathicgb/CFile.hpp .cpp

A RAII handle for a C FILE*. The purpose of using the C IO interface
instead of iostreams is that the former is faster to a ridiculous
degree. This class wraps the C IO interface to be more useful in a C++
context. For example the file is automatically closed in the
destructor and if the file cannot be opened then an exception is
thrown instead of returning a null pointer.

Project (small-effort, easy-difficulty): Grep for FILE* and see if
there's any place where an owning FILE* can be replaced by a CFile.


*** mathicgb/ClassicGBAlg.hpp .cpp

Calculates a classic Groebner basis using Buchberger's
algorithm. MathicGB implements the classic Groebner basis algorithm
for comparison and because sometimes that is the better
algorithm. MathicGB's classic implementation is not as mature as the
ones in Singular or Macaulay 2, but it can still be faster than those
implementations in some cases because of the use of fast data
structures from Mathic. The matrix-based reducer implementation (F4)
also IS the classic Buchberger implementation, since the skeleton of
those two algorithms is the same. The only difference is how many
S-pairs are reudced at a time. ClassicGBAlg has a parameter that tells
it at most how many S-pairs to reduce at a time. Choose 1 for classic
computation and more than 1 for matrix-based reduction.

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): The heuristic used for the
preferable way to bunch S-pairs together for the matrix-based
reduction is to select all of the S-pairs in a given degree, up to the
maximum number of S-pairs allowed by the parameter. This is exactly
the right thing to do for homogeneous inputs. It it not at all a good
idea for non-homogeneous inputs. The grading used is just the first
grading/row in the monomial order, so even for homogeneous inputs this
can be bad if the ordering used does not consider the true homogeneous
degree before anything else (for example it might consider the
component first). Make up a better way to bunch S-pairs together. For
example sugar degree. There will need to be lots of experiments here.

This class prints a lot of nice statistics about the computation
process. This code is a good example of how to use
mathic::ColumnPrinter for easy formatting. The statistics are
collected individually from different classes instead of using the
MathicGB logging system. For example a manual timer is used instead of
a logging timer.

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): Change the statistics
being reported to be collected via the MathicGB logging system. This
may require expanding the capabilities of the logging system. You may
also want to add additional interesting statistics gathering. You'll
need to measure the difference between compile-time disabling all logs
and then enabling them all at run-time (but not enabled for streaming
output, because that will always be slow). The difference in time
should preferably be < 2%. If that's not the case, then you'll need to
disable some of the logs by default at compile-time until it is the
case.

The Buchberger implementation always auto top reduces the basis. There
is an option for whether or not to do auto tail reduction. This option
is off by default because it is too slow. There are two reasons for
that. First, the auto tail reduction is done one polynomial at a time,
so it is not a good fit for the matrix-based reducers. Second, we need
a better heuristic to select which polynomials are auto tail reduced
when.

Project (medium-effort, easy-difficulty): When using a matrix-based
reducer (as indicated by a large requested S-pair group size), tail
reduce many basis elements at the same time instead of one at a time.

Project (medium-to-large-effort, medium-to-hard-difficulty): Figure
out and implement a good heuristic that makes auto tail reduction a
win. For example, it probably makes sense to auto tail reduce basis
elements that are frequently used as reducers more often than basis
elements that are almost never used as reducers.

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): Currently all the basis
elements are inserted into the intermediate basis right away. We might
as well wait with inserting a polynomial if it will not participate in
any reduction or S-pair for a long time yet. This is especially so for
homogeneous inputs, where there is no reason to insert a basis element
in degree d until the computation gets to degree d. If we also wait
with reducing these input basis elements until they finally get
inserted, then that would, for homogeneous computations, furthermore
ensure that all polynomials are both top and tail reduced all the time
without re-reductions.

*** mathicgb/F4MatrixBuilder.hpp .cpp
*** mathicgb/F4MatrixBuilder2.hpp .cpp

These classes are used by F4Reducer to construct the matrix used in
F4. The code is parallel. This is an important piece of code because
matrix construction can be a large part of the running time of
matrix-based reduction (see slides). There are lots of ways of
improving the reduction code and if all of those ideas are realized,
then it might turn out that matrix construction will end up being the
dominant use of time for F4!

F4MatrixBuilder is the first version that does left/right and
top/bottom splitting right away as the matrix is constructed (see
slides and ABCD paper). F4MatrixBuilder2 postpones that split until
after the matrix has been constructed. The advantage of
F4MatrixBuilder is that it does not require a second splitting step,
which enables it to run faster. However, without a second step there
is then no way to sort the rows of the matrix within the top and
bottom parts, so they appear in some arbitrary permutation. This makes
the cache performance of the subsequent reduction worse, so that
actually F4MatrixBuilder causes a slower total computation time than
F4MatrixBuilder2 even though F4MatrixBuilder2 takes more time to
construct the matrix.

The interface for the two classes is the same. First the user
describes the required matrix and then that matrix is constructed.

Parallelism is achieved here by having each core work on separate rows
of the matrix. The main point of synchronization between the cores is
that they need to agree on which monomial has which column index. This
is achieved via a lockless-for-readers hash table, implemented using
std::atomic (well, actually mgb::Atomic, but it's the same thing). To
understand the parallelism here you will need to understand how
lockless algorithms work and the interface of std::atomic, which is
going to be a significant effort to learn. The outcome of this way of
doing it is that look-ups in the hash table are no slower on x86 than
they would be in a serial program - it's the same CPU instructions
being run (there might be a slight slowdown if contending for a cache
line with a writer, but that's very rare). Writers do need to hold a
lock for insertion, but since look-ups are much more frequent than
column insertions, this is not so bad.

TBB (Intel Thread Building blocks) is used to keep track of the work
items to do so that cores can do work-stealing without much overhead.

Project (medium-difficulty, medium-effort): An advantage of
F4MatrixBuilder2's approach is that we can output the matrix and get a
raw matrix that is not processed in any way. This matrix can then be
used as input to other F4 projects to compare the speed of
implementations. The project is to make this happen - write the output
code and benchmark other projects on those matrices. This is already
somewhat done, in that MathicGB can input and output matrices, but
this is only done for the F4MatrixBuilder where the matrix is already
split into ABCD parts. Other projects won't know what to do with a
matrix in that format.

Project (medium-difficulty, high-effort): Determine if any other
project's matrix construction code is competitive with MathicGB. I do
not think that this is the case, but it could be - I haven't
measured. Quantify how much better/worse MathicGB is for matrix
construction and determine the reasons for the difference. If there is
something else competitive, either improve MathicGB using those ideas
or build that other project as a library and make MathicGB able to use
that other project's code for matrix construction.

Project (possibly-impossible, unknown-effort): Significantly simplify
the matrix construction code without making it slower (measure measure
measure) or reducing its capabilities.

Project (low-difficulty, low-effort): Count the number of lookups
versus the number of insertions in the hash table to verify and
quantify the claim made above that lookups are much more frequent than
insertions. The purpose of this is to find out the number of cores
where contention for the insertion lock becomes significant. This can
be done just by looking at the matrix - each non-zero entry was a
lookup, each column was an insertion. Get numbers for a wide variety
of matrices.

Project (medium-difficulty, medium-effort): Optimize the insertion
code. See if you can reduce the amount of time where the insertion
lock is held. If you determine that there is contention for the
insertion lock and this really is a problem, consider using several
insertion locks, for example 10 locks, one for each hash-value/bucket-index
modulo 10.

Project (medium-difficulty, low-effort): Make F4MatrixBuilder offer
exception guarantees. At least it should not leak memory on
exceptions. I think F4MatrixBuilder2 might need this too.

Project (low-effort, low-difficulty): Rename F4MatrixBuilder and
F4MatrilxBuilder2 to something more descriptive.

Project (possibly-impossible, high-effort): Make F4MatrixBuilder2
construct its matrix faster than F4MatrixBuilder does. Then remove
F4MatrixBuilder.

Project (possibly-impossible, high-effort): Most of the time in
constructing a matrix goes into looking a monomial up to find the
corresponding column index. Find a way to improve the code for this so
that it goes faster both serial and in parallel. Perhaps use SSE
instructions?  (this will likely require changing MonoMonoid, which
won't be easy).

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): There is no limit on how much
memory might be required to store the constructed matrix. Find a way
to construct it in pieces so that the memory use can be bounded. This
should not impact performance for matrices that fit within the
required memory and it should not slow down computations for large
matrices too much.

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): Matrix construction speed does
not scale perfectly with the number of cores. Determine the reason(s)
for this and fix them to get perfect scaling up to, say, 20
cores. Perhaps use something like Intel VTune, which I hear is great
for this sort of thing.


*** mathicgb/F4MatrixProjection.hpp .cpp

This class is used by F4MatrixBuilder2 for the second step where the
matrix is split into parts ABCD. F4MatrixProjection is fed all of the
sub-matrices built by the parallel cores in the construction step and
it is told what all the columns are and which ones are left and which
ones are right. Then it builds a QuadMatrix, which is the 4 matrices
A,B,C,D.

The first thing done is to figure out the necessary permutation of
rows. Note that it is really up to this class itself to choose which
rows are top/bottom, since that does not change the row echelon form
of the matrix. The only restriction is that a row with no entry on the
left must be on the bottom and that every left column must have
exactly one top row with the leading non-zero entry in that row - or
equivalently, the upper left matrix must be upper-triangular with no
zeroes on the diagonal. The row permutation constructed chooses the
sparsest rows that it can as the top rows, since those are going to be
used multiple times for reduction.

After the row permutation has been constructed, it is just a question
of going through every row in the order that the permutation dictates
and split it into the left/right sub-matrices.

This process has a memory issue in that it copies the matrix to
permute the rows and this doubles memory use. We cannot free the rows
that have already been copied because the memory for rows is allocated
in blocks and we cannot free a block until all rows in that block are
copied - and the rows are being copied in some arbitrary order
depending on the row permutation. Doubling memory here is bad because
the memory required to store the matrix can dwarf the memory otherwise
used by Buchberger's algorithm, which is already a lot of memory.

Project (medium-effort, high-difficulty): Find a way to apply the row
permutation and left/right splitting without doubling memory use. This
might be achieved by copying several times. The difficulty is in
finding a way to do this that inflates memory use only a little
(instead of doubling it) while also getting excellent performance. One
idea would be to use a harddisk for temporary storage. If the whole
thing cannot be done quickly, it might make sense only to use this
technique if memory would have been exhuasted by doubling the memory
used - in that case any amount of slow-down is worth it, since
otherwise the computation cannot proceed (at least not without using
virtual memory, which is going to be quite slow most likely).

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): The left/right and top/bottom
split is not parallel. Make it parallel. The obvious way to do this is
to construct the rows of the output matrices in blocks and to have
each thread do its own block. The easiest way is to do A,B,C,D in
parallel, but this parallelim can be done also on sub-matrices of
A,B,C,D.

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): For best speed on matrix
reduction, we do not just want to split into left/right and
top/bottom, we want to split the whole matrix into blocks of a
cache-appropriate size, while also (probably) doing the top/bottom
left/right thing. This will require a redesign of how the program
handles these submatrices.

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): There is also a difficult
question of how to sub-divide into cache-appropriate blocks on sparse
matrices, since sub-matrices in a sparse matrix will vary widely in
memory size, so a regular grid of sub-matrices might not be optimal -
some sub-matrices might need to be bigger than others in order to get
each sub-matrix to take up about the same amount of memory. The
literature might have something to say about this.


*** mathicgb/F4MatrixReducer.hpp .cpp

This is where the reduction of the matrices happens. For the reduction
of the left part of the matrix, each bottom row is reduced in
parallel. An active row is copied into a dense format and then the
sparse top rows are used to reduce it. This is good because the linear
algebra of applying a sparse reducer to a dense reducee can be
implemented well on a computer. (see slides)

Using delayed modulus is an important optimization here. (see slides)

After this we still need to interreduce the rows of the bottom right
part of the matrix, which can take a significant amount of time. This
is done by choosing a subset of rows with new pivots and reducing the
other rows with respect to these rows, which can be done in
parallel. This step is repeated until all rows become pivot rows or
zero rows. Part of the problem here is that selecting the set of pivot
rows introduces synchronization points so that there might be a lot of
waiting for the last core to finish, because there is a wait at the
end of every step. Since reducees need to be converted into dense
format and then back, there is either a very high memory consumption
(for keeping everything dense, which is the way it's done now) or
there is a lot of overhead for converting between dense and sparse
formats.

Schrawan made a non-parallel implementation that has only 1 active row
at a time, so there is no explosion in memory use when a very sparse
lower right matrix needs to be reduced. The skeleton of the algorithm
used for that implementation is also what I'd recommend for a future
parallel implementation using atomics.

Project (high-difficulty, medium effort): Schrawan finished his code,
but he never got it into MathicGB. Get him to put it into MathicGB.

Project (high-difficulty, medium-effort): Implement a parallel reduction
without synchronization points using atomics. Cores would be competing
for who gets to have a pivot in a given column and they would keep
going until their active row is either reduced to zero or it becomes a
pivot.

Project (high-difficulty, high-effort): Scour the literature to find a
good parallel algorithm. Implement it. See if it is better. Possibly
use different algorithms depending on the sparsity of the matrix. Some
lower right matrices are very dense and some are very sparse and some
are in-between.

Project (high-difficulty, high-effort): Use vector intrinsics (SSE and
it's like) to speed up the matrix reduction.

Project (high-difficulty, high-effort): Use GPU's to speed up the
matrix reduction.

Project (medium-difficulty, high-effort): Try out BLAS for this
purpose. Try out other already-implemented libraries that might be
useful. There is also the sparse blas. Can that be used?

Project (medium-difficulty, high-effort): The current implementation
is for 16 bit primes. Make it work/optimize it for 8 bits and 32 bit
primes as well. There is a C++ library for doing lots of modulus
operations by a fixed (but not compile-time constant) integer using
fancy bit tricks, but for the life of me I cannot find this library's
website again - something like that might be quite useful, since
higher bit primes is going to decrease the usefulness of the delayed
modulus technique.

*** mathicgb/F4ProtoMatrix.hpp .cpp

This class is used by F4MAtrixBuilder2 to store the sub-matrices
constructed by each core during the initial matrix construction
step. Memory is stored in large std::vector's.

There is a slight special thing about storing the coefficients. If a
row in the matrix is m*f for m a monomial and f a basis element, then
there is no reason to store the coefficients, since the coefficients
will be just the same as the coefficients of f. We can instead just
refer to f. If a row is mf-ng, on the other hand, then we do need to
store the coefficients. F4ProtoMatrix keeps track of this, so that
some rows have their coefficients stored as a reference to a
polynomial and other rows have their coefficients stored explicitly
within the F4ProtoMatrix itself.

Project (medium-difficulty, medium-effort): See if it wouldn't be
faster to store the sub-matrices in fixed-size blocks of memory
instead of in std::vector. push_back on std::vector is O(1), but the
constant is greater than for allocating reasonably sized blocks and
using those. There is a tricky special case if a very large row uses
more memory than the block size. This would decrease memory use, too,
since vector wastes up to half of its memory and these vectors can be
huge.

*** mathicgb/F4Reducer.hpp .cpp

This class exposes the matrix-based reduction functionality as a
sub-class of Reducer. So the rest of the code can use F4 without
knowing much about it.

F4Reducer can write out matrices, but only after splitting into
left/right and top/bottom.

Project (low-effort, low-difficulty): A lot of the logging here is
done using tracingLevel. Move that logging to use the MathicGB logging
system.

*** mathicgb/FixedSizeMonomialMap.h

This is a parallel atomic-based hash table that maps monomials to a
template type T, generally an integer. The hash table is chained
because it needs to refer to monomials anyway which requires a
pointer, so there is no reason not to use chaining. The next pointer
in the chain and the value is stored right next to the monomial in
memory. The hash table is fixed size in that it cannot rehash or
change the number of buckets. The hash table cannot change its size
because of the nature of the paralellism used - there is no way to
force all the cores to be aware of the new rehashed hash table (it's a
bit like read-copy-update used in the Linux kernel, except that
there's no fixed amount of waiting that will make it safe to
deallocate the old memory). MathicGB never the less does achieve
rehashing and growing the hash table, just not directly within a
single FixedSizeMonomialMap - see MonomialMap.

A lot of effort went into making the following operation as fast as
possible:

  findProduct(a,b): return the value of the entry corresponding to a*b.

where a,b are monomials. That's because that is where most of the time
for matrix construction goes. Most of the time for matrix construction
still goes there despite significant gains in speeding this up. (see
slides)

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): Find a way to significantly
speed up the findProduct operation. Perhaps SSE can help, or some kind
of cache prefetch instructions. Or a change to memory layout.

Project (low-effort, low-difficulty): This file is for some reason
called .h instead of .hpp. Fix that.

Project: Get an expert on parallel algorithms to review this part of
the code. Perhaps something can be improved?

*** mathicgb/io-util.hpp .cpp

This file collects a lot of IO and toString related
functionality. This functionality has been superseded by the MathicIO
class.

Project (medium-effort, low-difficulty): Migrate the remaining uses of
io-util over to use MathicIO and then remove io-util.

*** KoszulQueue.hpp 

Used to keep track of pending Koszul syzygy signatures in the
signature basis (SB) algorithm. SB keeps a priority queue (ordered
queue) of certain Koszul signatures that are greater than the current
signature -- see the SB paper.

*** LogDomain.hpp .cpp
*** LogDomainSet.hpp .cpp

These files form the MathicGB logging system. A LogDomain is a named
area of logging that can be turned on or off at runtime and at compile
time.

A logger that is turned off at compile time emits no code into the
executable and all the code that writes to that logger is also removed
by the optimizer if it is written in the correct way. Use the logging
macroes to ensure proper use so that compile-time disabled LogDomains
properly have zero overhead. LogDomains can be turned on and off at
compile time and at runtime individually.

Here logging means both outputting messages to the screen right away
and collecting statistics for showing later summary information about
the computation. See these files for further details.

Compile-time enabled loggers automatically register themselves at
start-up with LogDomainSet::singleton(). LogDomainSet is a singleton
that keeps track of all the logging domains.

Project (low-effort, medium-difficulty): support turning all loggers
off globally at compile time with a single macro, regardless of their
individual compile-time on/off setting. This would allow an easy way
to measure the overhead of the logging.

Project (high-effort, medium-difficulty): replace all logging based on
trace-level or adhoc-counters with use of the MathicGB logging system.


*** mathicgb.h

This is the entire library interface of MathicGB. It's full of
documentation, so go read the file if you want to know how the library
interface works. Clients of the library should not #include any other
file from MathicGB.

This is the only file that's supposed to be called .h instead of .hpp,
since it is included from the outside and .h is the customary header
even for C++ headers.

Project(medium-effort, medium-difficulty): Expand the library
interface to expose the ability to compute signature bases. Both as in
getting a signature basis output and as in using a signature basis
algorithm to compute a classic Groebner basis.

Project(medium-effort, medium-difficulty): This header hides all of
its implementation using the pimpl pattern. It would be nice if the
header and the implementation were so separate that you could even
compile on different compilers and still have work. That requires an
interface that uses extern "C" as calling convention. So get the
separation to that level. Though I'm not actually so knowledgeable
about this matter, so first do some research on this kind of thing to
figure out what makes sense and then do that.

*** MathicIO.hpp

This file collects all IO-related functionality for MathicGB
objects. This is reasonable since most of the IO-relevant classes are
composites whose IO requires IO of its pieces. So putting it together
lowers compile time and avoids cluttering up all the various classes
with IO code.

Project (medium-effort, low-difficulty): The input and output code is
completely separate, so it was silly of me to put it on the same
class. Separate this class input MathicInput and MathicOutput. That
would allow each class to keep a bit of state - the file or
ostream/istream that is being written to/read from. The state of
MathicInput would be a Scanner. The state of MathicOutput would be at
first an ostream. However, std::ostream is extremely slow, so you'd
probably want to migrate that to a FILE*. To be more fancy, you could
keep a largish buffer and then allow output of that buffer to either
an ostream or a FILE*. Both FILE* and ostream has per-operation
overhead, so this will likely be the fastest approach anyway - and it
mirrors what Scanner does.

Project (high-effort, medium-difficulty): The current file format is a
complete mess and it's not documented. It shouldn't be too hard to
figure out from looking at the IO code what the format is. Come up
with a much better format and implement it. The problems with the
current format include that you can have at most 52 variables and the
way that the monomial order is specified is weird. If this is too much
work, at least document what the current format is, weird as it may
be.

*** mathicgb/ModuleMonoSet.hpp .cpp

Allows operations on the ideal generated by a set of module
monomials. Currently used for signatures. This is a virtual interface
with several implementations based on different mathic data
structures. The templates are instantiated in the .cpp file to hide
them from the rest of the code. The implementations are based on
StaticMonoLookup.

*** mathicgb/MonoLookup.hpp .cpp

Supports queries on the lead terms of the monomials in a PolyBasis or
a SigPolyBasis. This is a virtual interface that is implemented in the
.cpp file using templates based on several different mathic data
structures. The implementations are based on StaticMonoLookup.

Project (medium-difficulty, medium-effort): It's a mess mixing classic
GB functionality, signature functionality and general monomial lookup
functionaliy like this. Find a good way to disentangle these things.

*** mathicgb/MonomialMap.hpp

A concurrent/parallel wrapper around FixedSizeMonomialMap. If the
current FixedsizeMonomialMap gets too full, a new one is created and
the nodes from that one are cannibalized into the new one, but the old
table is still kept around. This way a core that is still using the
old table will not get memory errors, that core just might fail to see
a monomial that is supposed to be there. The matrix construction code
is written so that not finding a monomial causes synchronization
followed by a second look-up. That second look-up will identify the
most recent hash table and use that for the lookup, so rehashing can
be done safely and quickly in this way. The only real penalty is that
all the old hash tables have to be kept around, but that is not much
memory.

*** MonoMonoid

This class implements monomials and ordering on (monic) monomials. It
is quite complicated but the interface is nice so all the complexity
is hidden from the rest of the program. The nasty stuff is handled
once here and then no where else. The interface is supposed to make it
impossible to create a mal-formed monomial, at least unless you do a
cast or refer to deallocated memory.

The eventual idea is to make everything a template on this class so
that the monomial representation can be radically changed at run-time
to suit a given computation with no overhead. So no other part of the
program should have any knowledge of how monoids are represented,
which is already almost (maybe even fully?) the case.

The memory layout of a monomial depends on template parameters to
MonoMonoid as well as on the number of variables, the monomial
ordering being used and the module monomial ordering being used.

It would take a long time to explain the whole thing and it is all
already documented well in the file, so go there for the details.

Changes to this class should be done with care, in part because it's
very easy to introduce bugs and in part because the code is carefully
written and almost all of it is performance critical - any change is
quite likely to make the program slower, so run lots of benchmarks
after changing something.

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): Make everything that interacts
with monomials a template on the Monoid. This has already been
started, by giving each class a typedef for Monoid - in future, this
will become the template parameter. The trick is to use virtual
interfaces to avoid the problem LELA has where any change to any part
of the program (almost) requires the whole program to be re-compiled.

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): Implement an alternative Monoid
that uses SSE instructions for fast monomial operations. The tricky
part here will be memory alignment and choosing the right
representation in memory. Then try that monoid out in benchmarks and
get a speed-up for inputs that cause a lot of monomial computations.

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): Implement an alternative monoid
that is specialized for 0-1 exponents in the presence of the equations
x^2=x, so that each exponent only requires 1 bit. Document a nice
speed-up on inputs with 0-1 exponents.

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): Make monoids that differ only
in their template boolean parameters (StoreHash, etc.) share part of
the same state (in particular, the ordering matrix), since it is the
same anyway. The trick is to do this without impacting performance
negatively.

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): Implement an alternative monoid
that uses a sparse representation so that only non-zero exponents are
stored. Document a nice speed-up on inputs where most exponents are
zero. The challenge here is that the monomials are no longer all the
same size. I've attempted to write the rest of the program without an
assumption of same-size monomials. The main problem will be
MonoPool. You'll want to eliminate as many uses of that as possible
(I've tried not to use it for new code) and then perhaps just eat the
waste of memory for the remaining few uses.

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): Implement an alternative monoid
that is optimized for toric/lattice ideals. These are binomial
saturated ideals where x^a-x^b can be represented with the single
vector a-b. Compare to 4ti2. Can we beat them?

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): Have monoids for 8 bit, 16 bit,
32 bit, 64 bit. When an exponent overflow occurs anywhere in the
program, take the current state of the computation and then transfer
that into the equivalent monoid with next-higher precision of
exponents.

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): As previous project, but also
include arbitrary precision exponents as the final monoid that can
handle any size exponent. This sort of thing becomes relevant for some
toric ideal computations and it's why 4ti2 has a build with arbitrary
precision exponents. The challenge here is that exponents now become
heavy resource handles - I'm not sure what making that change will
require. Copying an exponent suddenly goes from cheap to very
expensive.

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): Currently it is allowed to mix
module monomials and monomials. They are not different
types. MonoMonoid already has a bool parameter intended to make this
separation (HasComponent). However, the rest of the code doesn't
observe the distinction, so HasComponent cannot be enforced. Fix that.

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): Make a MonoMonoid that uses an
internal virtual interface so that it can implement any monoid
what-so-ever. Then expose that functionality through the library
interface, so that external clients can run Groebner basis
computations on their own monoids. This will likely be slow, but
that's OK - if that's not acceptable, then just don't use this monoid.

*** mathicgb/MonoOrder.hpp

Class used to describe an monomial order and/or a module monomial
order. Use this class to construct a monoid. The monoid does the
actual comparisons. Module monomials must be preprocessed by
MonoProcessor - otherwise the ordering may not be
correct. MonoProcessor offers additional parameters for making orders.


*** mathicgb/MonoProcessor.hpp

Does pre- and post-processing of monomials to implement module
monomial orders not directly supported by the monoid. This is the case
for Schreyer orderings and for changing the direction of which
component e_i is greater. You need to use this class if you are doing
input or output of module monomials, since the external world will not
know or want to know about the transformations used to achieve these
orderings.


*** mathicgb/mtbb.hpp

A compatibility layer for tbb. tbb stans for Intel thread building
blocks and it's a good library for implementing parallel
algorithms. If we are compiling with tbb present, then the classes in
the mtbb namespace will simply be typedefs for the same classes as in
the tbb namespace. However, if we are compiling without tbb (so
without parallelism), then these classes will be trivial non-parallel
implementations that allows MathicGB to work without tbb being
present. TBB doesn't work on Cygwin, so that is at least one good
reason to have this compatibility layer. This only works if all uses
of tbb go through the mtbb namespace, so make sure to do that.

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): get TBB to work on Cygwin and
get an official TBB-Cygwin package into Cygwin.


*** mathicgb/NonCopyable.hpp

Derive from NonCopyable to disable the compiler-generated copy
constructor and assignment. In C++11 this can be done with deleted
methods, but support for that is not universal, so use this instead
for now.


*** mathicgb/Poly.hpp

Poly stores a polynomial. This was originally a large and somewhat
complicated class, but not so much any more since PrimeField and
MonoMonoid now offer encapsulation for everything having to do with
how coefficients and monomials are to be handled. Poly is now mostly
just a thin layer on top of those abstractions.


*** mathicgb/PolyBasis.hpp

Stores a basis of polynomials. Designed for use in Groebner basis
algorithms - PolyBasis offers functionality like finding a good
reducer for a monomial.


*** mathicgb/PolyHashTable.hpp

A hash table that maps monomials to coefficients. Used in classic
polynomial reducers. The implementation is very similar to MonomialMap
except that this hash table is not designed for concurrent use.


*** mathicgb/PolyRing.hpp

Represents a polynomial ring. Deals with terms - a monomial with a
coefficient. It used to be that this class handled everything to do
with coefficients and monomials so it has a very large interface
related to all that because some of the code still uses that old
interface. It is supposed now to be just the combination of a field
and a monoid - eventually it would become a template on those two.

In future Poly might become a nested class on PolyRing, just like Mono
is a sub-class of MonoMonoid. I'm not sure if it is a good idea. The
question is if it would ever make sense to use two different
representations of polynomials from the same PolyRing. I think
probably not, but I'm not sure.

Project (high effort, medium difficulty): Get rid of all the remaining
code that uses the coefficient and monomial interface of PolyRing and
migrate those to use MonoMonoid and PrimeField. Then clean up the
PolyRing header to remove all that stuff that is then no longer
needed. This would involve moving code to use NewConstTerm and then
please rename that to just ConstTerm and make it a nested type of
PolyRing that everything uses.


*** mathicgb/PrimeField.hpp

Implements modular arithmetic. Is to coefficients what MonoMonoid is
to monomials. Ideally, it would be possible to swap in a different
coefficient field just by implementing an alternative to
PrimeField. For example computations over Z or Q or something more
complicated would then be possible. This is a more far-off feature and
the code base is much less prepared for this than it is for
alternative monoids. On the other hand, less of the code does much
with coefficients than monomials, so it might not be that bad.

Project (high-effort, low-difficulty): A lot of code still uses the
PolyRing interface for coefficients. Move that code to use PrimeField
and then remove the implicit conversions between PrimeField::Element
and the underlying coefficient type. The idea here is that it should
be impossible to use coefficients incorrectly by mistake. For example
it is very easy to just add two coefficient using + by mistake, which
is bad because then you do not get the modulus and you might get an
overflow.

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): Have modular coefficient
fields with 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits. Then use the appropriate size at
run-time for the given modulus. Right now we use a 32 bit integer, yet
the matrix-based reducer only supports 16 bit primes, leaving half the
coefficient bits wasted for any computation using the matrix-based
reducer.

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): Implement a coefficient field
over Z or Q and use that.

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): Make a Field that uses an
internal virtual interface so that it can implement any coefficient
field what-so-ever. Then expose that functionality through the library
interface, so that external clients can run Groebner basis
computations on their own field implementations. This will likely be
slow, but that's OK - if that's not acceptable, then just don't use
this field.

*** mathicgb/QuadMatrix.hpp .cpp

A struct that stores 4 matrices, top/left and bottom/right, and
left/right column monomials that describe what monomial corresponds to
each column (see ABCD paper and slides). There is also some
functionality, such as printing statistics about the matrices and
doing IO of the matrices.

This class is a mess. It's written like a pure data struct just
keeping a few fields but it has extra functionality. It keeps lists of
column monomials and a monoid even though it is used in places where
there is no monoid.

Project(low-difficulty, medium-effort): Encapsulate the 4 matrices
instead of having them be public fields. Then move the vectors of
column monomials and the PolyRing reference to some other place so
that a QuadMatrix can be used in contexts where there are no monomials
- such as when reading a matrix from disk. Also move the IO to
MathicIO.


*** mathicgb/QuadMatrixBuilder.hpp

Used by F4MatrixBuilder to do the splitting into left/right and
top/bottom during matrix construction. Not a lot of code here.


*** mathicgb/Range.hpp

Introduces basic support for the range concept. A range is,
conceptually, what you get when you have a begin and an end
iterator. Combining these together into one thing allows a more
convenient coding style and this header makes that easy. This also
combines very well with the C++11 range-based for loop, which allows
iteration through a range object. See the documentation in the file
for more details on what this is all about.

Project(high-difficulty, high-effort): Get on the C++ standard
committee working group for ranges and get them to put better support
for ranges into the standard library as quickly as possible!


*** mathicgb/Reducer.hpp .cpp

This is a virtual interface that encapsulates polynomial reduction. It
allows the rest of the code to use any of many different
reduction implementations without having to know about the details.


*** mathicgb/ReducerDedup.hpp .cpp
*** mathicgb/ReducerHash.hpp .cpp
*** mathicgb/ReducerHashPack.hpp .cpp
*** mathicgb/ReducerHelper.hpp .cpp
*** mathicgb/ReducerNoDedup.hpp .cpp
*** mathicgb/ReducerNoDedup.hpp .cpp
*** mathicgb/ReducerPack.hpp .cpp
*** mathicgb/ReducerPackDedup .cpp

These implement various ways of doing classic polynomial
reduction. They register themselves with Reducer using a global
object, so if you change one of these files, only that single file
will be recompiled. The same is true of F4Reducer.

Project(high-difficulty, high-effort): Improve these reducers. The
fastest one is ReducerHash. Make it faster! :)


*** mathicgb/Scanner.hpp .cpp

A class that is very convenient for parsing input, much more so than
std::istream. It is also faster than using std::istream or FILE*
directly. It can accept (buffered) input from either a std::istream or
a FILE*. All text input should go through a Scanner and for a given
input it should all go through the same scanner since the scanner
keeps track of the line number for better error messages - that only
works if no part of the input is read from outside of the scanner.

 
*** mathicgb/ScopeExit.hpp

Implements a scope guard. Very convenient for ad-hoc RAII
needs. Naming the scope guard is optional.

Example:
  FILE* file = fopen("file.txt", "r");
  MATHICGB_SCOPE_EXIT() {
    fclose(file);
    std::cout << "file closed";
  };
  // ...
  return; // the file is closed

Example:
  v.push_back(5);
  MATHICGB_SCOPE_EXIT(name) {v.pop_back();};
  // ...
  if (error)
    return; // the pop_back is done
  name.dismiss();
  return; // the pop_back is not done


*** mathicgb/SignatureGB.hpp

Implements the SB algorithm.

Project(medium-effort, low-difficulty): Wait with inserting the input
basis elements into the basis until their signature becomes <= the
currrent signature. Then regular reduce them at that point. This
ensures that the basis is regular auto reduced at all times without
doing any auto reduction - otherwise it isn't. This actually might
even be a correctness issue for the case where the input basis is not
already top auto reduced!

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): Combine SB with matrix-based
reduction.

Project(high-effort, medium-difficulty): Migrate all the code here
from using ad-hoc statistics and logging to using the MathicGB logging
system.

Project(high-effort, high-difficulty): Implement better support for
incremental module orderings ("module lex" or "component first"),
especially in the case where we only want a Groebner basis and not a
signature Groebner basis. Between incremental steps, it would be
possible to reduce to a Groebner basis and possibly also a win to
dehomogenize and re-homogenize. This is likely a huge improvement for
some examples.


*** mathicgb/SigPolyBasis.hpp .cpp

Stores a basis of polynomials that each have a signature. Designed for
use in signature Groebner basis algorithms.


*** mathicgb/SigSPairQueue.hpp .cpp

A priority queue on S-pairs where the priority is based on a signature
as in signature Grobner basis algorithms. The class is not responsible
for eliminating S-pairs or doing anything beyond order the S-pairs.


*** mathicgb/SigSPairs.hpp .cpp

Handles S-pairs in signature Grobner basis algorithms. Responsible for
eliminating S-pairs, storing S-pairs and ordering S-pairs. See SB
paper.


*** mathicgb/SPairs.hpp .cpp

Stores the set of pending S-pairs for use in the classic Buchberger
algorithm. Also eliminates useless S-pairs and orders the
S-pairs. Uses a novel S-pair elimination criterion based on minimum
spanning trees in a certain graph. Should be slightly better than the
Gebaeur-Moeller criterion. See description at end of online appendix
to SB paper.


Project(medium-effort, high-difficulty): There's a tricky issue
here. SPairs computes the lcm of the leading term of components of an
S-pair in order to figure out if that S-pair can be eliminated. It is
not necessary to compute the hash value or the degree (=ordering data)
of the lcm to figure that out. So it uses a monoid instantiated not to
compute these things. However, the monomial lookup data structure used
is for the usual monoid that does have these things. So the types
don't match. These types are layout-compatible, so I fix this
currently by breaking encapsulation and just casting from one type to
the other, creating a monomial with invalid hash and degree
information - though that works out because the lookup data structure
never looks at those field. This is not a good solution. A good
solution would be to expose the layout-compatibility and allow
conversion of references between the monoids so that the lookup data
structure could advertise just an interface based on the bare monoid
(no pre-computed hash or ordering data) and then that interface could
be used directly on monomials from the usual monoid via (possibly
implicit) conversions of MonoidWithManyField::ConstMonoRef to
MonoidWithFewerFields::ConstMonoRef. Or find a better solution!

*** mathicgb/SparseMatrix.hpp

Stores a matrix in sparse format. Column indices are stored separately
from scalars. Column indices and scalars are stored in large blocks of
memory and a matrix is a sequence of such blocks. The row metadata
(where is the scalars and indices for this row?) is stored in a single
std::vector. It was a significant speed-up when I moved to this block
structure from the previous design which stored scalars in one huge
std::vector and indices in another huge std::vector. This is the
default class used to store matrices. For example a QuadMatrix
consists of 4 SparseMatrices.


*** mathicgb/StaticMonoMap.hpp

A template class for implementating many monomial look-up data
structure operations. Based on mathic data structures and which one
you want is a template parameter. Used as the underlying
implementation for most (all?) of the monomial lookup data structures in
MathicGB.


*** mathicgb/stdinc.h

This file is the first file included by all .cpp files in
MathicGB. Therefore everything in it is available everywhere. This
file contains a lot of macroes and some typedefs that should be
available everywhere.

Project(medium-effort, low-difficulty): This file should be named
stdinc.hpp, not stdinc.h. Rename it.

Project(medium-effort, low-difficulty): Pre-compiled headers should
speed up compilation of MathicGB tremendously. Especially putting
memtailor and mathic in a precompiled header should help. Probably
also MonoMonoid, PrimeField, PolyRing and parts of the STL. Set up
support for this in MSVC and GCC. Half the work is already done since
stdinc.h can be the precompiled header - it's already included as the
first thing everywhere.


*** mathicgb/TypicalReducer.hpp .cpp

All the non-matrix based reducers use the same classic polynomial
reduction high-level algorithm. This class implements that high-level
algorithm and then a sub-class can specialize the detailed steps, thus
sharing a lot of code between the various reducers.


*** Unchar.hpp 

std::ostream and std::istream handle characters differently from other
integers. That is not desired when using char as an integer. Use
Unchar and unchar() to cast integers to a different type (short) if
they are char.


*** test/*

These are unit tests.

Project(high-effort, medium-difficulty): Find things that are not
currently tested and add tests for them.


*** cli/*

This is for the command line interface.

Project (low-effort, low-difficulty): Emit a better and more helpful
message when running mgb with no parameteres. At a minimum, point
people to the help action.


***** Other projects

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): The leading terms of
monomials in the basis are not placed together in memory. Placing them
together in memory might improve cache performance for monomial
queries.

Project (high-effort, low-difficulty): In a lot of places 0 is used to
indicate the null pointer. Replace all of those zeroes by the proper
C++11 keyword: nullptr.

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): The matrix based reducer
checks overflow of exponents (using the "ample" concept from
MonoMonoid). The other reduceres do not. Fix that. What is the
performance impact?

Project (medium-effort, high-difficulty): The tournament trees in
mathic are non-intrusive. An intrusive tournament tree should be
faster. Try that.

Project (high-effort, low-difficulty): In some places in MathicGB and
in lots of places in memtailor and mathic, methods are named
getFoo(). Change that to just foo(). Also, mathic and memtailor use _
as a prefix to indicate a member variable. That's a terrible idea,
since the standard reserves names starting with an underscore to be
used only by the standard library implementation. (well, strictly
speaking the prefixes __ and _ followed by an upper case letter, but
still).

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): memtailor, mathic and
mathicgb download and compile gtest automatically if gtest is not
found on the system. mathicgb should do the same thing with memtailor
and mathic. That would ease installation greatly.

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): There are a lot of
comments using /// all over, which indicates to doxygen that this is a
comment that should be included as part of the documentation. However,
there is not a doxygen makefile target! Make one.

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): The library interface
should have an option to get a fully auto-reduced (including
tail-reduced) Groebner basis at the end.

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): The makefile made by
mathicgb/build/setup/make-Makefile.sh has a target called ana. This
stands for analysis. What it does is that it runs gcc with all
warnings that I could find anywhere turned on and it treats warnings
as errors. memtailor, mathic and mathicgb should build with this
target without any warnings or errors. That's currently not the case,
so that should be fixed.

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): Make a makefile target
like ana, but targeting clangs static analysis tool(s). Then silence
all the issues that come up.

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): Files should include what
they use and no more than that. They should also prefer forward
declarations when that is sufficient. This eases the development
process as it avoids errors from missing headers and it avoids
unnecessary recompilations. Maintaining the invariant that every file
includes exactly what it needs and no more isn't practical to do by
hand. The tool include-what-you-use flags every missing header, every
superfluous header and every include that could be replaced by a
forward declaration. http://code.google.com/p/include-what-you-use/
. Make a makefile target like ana that runs include-what-you-use over
everything.

Project (high-effort, medium-difficulty): All the Groebner basis
implementations are based on giving each basis element an index and
then maintaining data structures that use those indices. As basis
elements become top-reducible, some of those indices fall out of use
(retired). If there are many retired indices, then that causes
overhead. For example the bit-triangle used to keep track of S-pairs
uses O(n^2) space where n is the number of indices - retired indices
still use just as much space. This can be fixed by reindexing - map
all the active indices to smaller indices so that there are no gaps
left for the retired indices - it's like they were never there. Update
all data structures simultaneously to use these new indices. This
could be done if, say, 1/2 of the indices become retired, or whatever
is a suitable fraction.

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): MathicGB uses local memory
threaded parallelism. Find a way to do computations also in a
distributed manner and get a good speed-up. Probably the matrix
reduction is the best first place to make this happen.

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): MathicGB currently uses
enums to identify the various different reducers and data
structures. These integer ids are even exposed in the command line
interface, so you say for example "give me reducer 24". This is not a
great design. Instead, give each reducer a string name and let the
command line interface use those. Enable unique prefix matching just
like is done for action names. Inside MathicGB, get rid of the enums
entirely. Avoid passing around strings to desribe the desired reducer,
for example. Instead just pass the actual reducer around.

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): Let the matrix-based reducer
run on modules.

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): Let MathicGB keep track of the
module representation of it's calculations - that is, how the output
basis is represented in terms of the input basis. Calculate syzygies
using this information.

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): Get MathicGB to run on
Clang. It might do that already. I don't know.

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): gcc has link time
optimization (lto) and profile-drive optimization. It can lead to
significant improvements in speed and we are not using those. Set up a
way to use these and measure the performance improvement. Is it worth
the hassle?

Project (high-effort, medium-difficulty): Benchmarking has so far been
quite ad-hoc. Set up a good battery of tests, both of ideals and
matrices. Maybe get external people involved too. Maybe have a server
that runs benchmarks and pulls from git each day and graphs the
results.

Project (medium-effort, medium-difficulty): Get a Sage interface to
MathicGB.

Project (high-effort, high-difficulty): Popularize MathicGB. Get
everyone to know about it. Attract more developers.

Project (high-effort, medium-difficulty): Write a nice user's manual.
